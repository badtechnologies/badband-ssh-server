# BadOS Package Manager (bpm)

Use the BPM (BadOS Package Manager) to install, remove, or otherwise manage packages.

Example: installing a package:

```sh
bpm install <package name>
```

For more information, run `bpm help`, or see the [bpm docs](bpm.md).

> [!TIP]
> When setting up bdsh for the first time, `bpm` is included in the setup script.
> If your bdsh installation does not have `bpm`, something went wrong; reconfigure or reinstall bdsh.
